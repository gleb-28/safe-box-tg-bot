# 🤖 Safe Box TG Bot

## ✨ Description

Safe Box is a Telegram bot that sends short, human-like nudges during the day based on user items
(e.g., "tea", "look out the window"). Messages are generated via an LLM in different styles
(rofl/cozy/care) and are delivered only within the user's day window, with randomized 60–180 minute (1–3 hour) intervals.
Access is gated by an activation key.

Note: notifications currently send the item name directly (LLM generation is planned).

Active hours are stored as DayStart/DayEnd minutes in 24-hour format; the notification worker runs once on startup
and then periodically to process due users.

## 🔒 Limits

- Max items per user: 200.
- Item names are normalized (trimmed, lowercased, collapsed spaces) and limited to 40 characters.

## 🧱 Tech stack

- **Go 1.25** – primary language.
- **Telebot v4** – Telegram framework.
- **Looplab FSM** – FSM.
- **GORM + sqlite driver** – persistence layer for chats and forward-mode settings (`gorm.io/gorm`, `gorm.io/driver/sqlite`).
- **SQLite** – lightweight storage for bot data.
- **cleanenv** – loads `.env` file.

## 📦 Requirements

Before running the bot make sure you have installed:
- Go 1.25
- SQLite

Check installed versions:
```bash
go version
sqlite3 --version
````

make build
```
### Run locally:

## 🚀 VPS Deployment

This guide shows how to deploy the bot on a fresh Ubuntu VPS using Docker.
All deployment assets (compose file, helper script, Dockerfile, and env templates) live under `deploy/`.

1. Create prod.env with and other constants:
```env
DB_FILE_NAME=/app/data/bot.db
```

2. Create `deploy/prod.env` (if you need to override the defaults above) and `deploy/deploy.env`, then run the deploy helper from the repo root:
```
sudo chmod +x deploy/deploy.sh && make deploy
```
